This repository includes some R code that I used to analyze and visually represent my data throughout my master's.

My work during my master's was on surface water quality and harmful algal blooms. Water quality analysis included measuring water chemistry parameters as well as identifying the cyanobacterial community via 16s rRNA using high through-put amplicon sequencing. 


This repository will continue to update.
